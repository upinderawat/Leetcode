## 75. Sort Colors
[Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
### Two Pointer(Accepted)
Idea is to keep a pointer at end of 0's and end of 1s. Consider already sorted partial list and think how to sort the remaining. At the sight of 1, increment optr (o here) and swap. At the sight of 0, 2 swaps are required.
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        z=o = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 2:
                o+=1
                nums[i], nums[o] = nums[o], nums[i]
                if nums[o] == 0:
                    z+=1
                    nums[o], nums[z] =  nums[z], nums[o]
        return nums
```
