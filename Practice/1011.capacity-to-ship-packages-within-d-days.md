## 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
[Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)
### Binary Search (Accepted)
Apply binary search on test weight(optimal weight which will satisfy the deadline constraint). Initial left and right can be initialized with max and sum of weights respectively.
```python
class Solution:
    def fn(self, weights, D, tw):
        #tw is test weight
        i = 1#number of days required for shipment 
        sumw = 0
        for w in weights:
            sumw += w
            if sumw > tw:
                i += 1
                sumw = w
        return i <= D
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        l = max(weights)
        r = sum(weights)
        while l < r:
            tw = l + (r-l)//2
            if self.fn(weights, D, tw):
                r = tw
            else:
                l = tw+1
        return r
